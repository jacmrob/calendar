{"name":"Calendar","tagline":"","body":"\r\n***\r\n### Introducing the Concentric Calendar\r\nAn intuitive way to keep track of time. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How do I read it?\r\nEach circle represents a unit of time, with a radius that grows dynamically in response to larger units.  Starting from the center, minutes (yellow) grow until they fill an hour, hours (blue) grow until they fill a day, days (purple) grow until they fill a month, and months (grey) grow until they fill a year (white). When all circles are full, the year is up!\r\n\r\n### Updates in real-time\r\nUsing Javascript's world clock, will be 100% accurate whenever you refresh your page.\r\n\r\n### How do I get it?\r\nAll coded exclusively in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
