Starting from the center, minutes (yellow) grow until they fill an hour, hours (blue) grow until they fill a day, days (purple) grow until they fill a month, and months (grey) grow until they fill a year (white). When all circles are full, the year is up!\r\n\r\n### Updates in real-time\r\nUsing Javascript's world clock, will be 100% accurate whenever you refresh your page.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
